### feature fix !
> in this project, user password is hashed and send to backend, also user password saved as hashed in database, so there is no point of use hashing. Sending password as plain text from frontend rather then hashed version, and hash it at the backend is best practice. Otherwise we just changin plain password to hashed password but still if someone access to our database, can use that hashed password while requesting to web api !!!!!
